# About

I love all things web and tech. Currently I'm getting heavily into **JavaScript**. This website is a place to put down and record progress, questions, and notes on various things I'm interested in or working on.

Some things you will find are notes on `code`, `articles`, and `books`.

Other things I'm interested in and have a passion for are [art](http://design48.net/clients/hoodlum), [racing motorcycles](http://www.ryanregalado.com), and most importantly [God](http://ryanregalado.com/news_aug2008.php).
