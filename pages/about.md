I love all things web and tech. Currently I'm getting heavily into **JavaScript**. This website is a place to put down and record progress, questions, and notes on various things I'm interested in or working on.

Some things you will find are notes on `code`, `articles`, and `books`.

Other items you will see are projects that I'm interested in like `painting`, `drawing` or building `mobile applications`.
