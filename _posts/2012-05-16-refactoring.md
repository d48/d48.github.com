## Book Notes - Refactoring : Tip

**Tip:**

> When you find you have to add a feature to a program, and the program's code is not structured in a convenient way to add the feature, first refactor the program to make iteasy to add the feature, then add the feature.

**First Step in Refactoring:**

Make sure your refactoring doesn't introduce bugs.

1. Build a set of solid test cases for that code. 
2. Make the tests self-checking: check for validity of expected value and actual value.
