# Learning Coffeescript

I will be implementing the mytestimony project using Coffeescript to accomplish a few things. 

	1. Learn new technology
	2. Decrease code in repository
	3. Attempt to have code more readable and maintainable

I just came across this [Codeschool](http://coffeescript.codeschool.com/) screencast and also this [Railscast video](http://railscasts.com/episodes/267-coffeescript-basics?view=asciicast). They both got me jazzed to learn it and can't wait to build the app. Now i'm looking through a few and learning some basics. I really like how clean the language is.
