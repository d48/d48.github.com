## Out with the old

I came across some blog layouts from developers I follow on twitter and I noticed an engine they used that I really like the layout for. So...I copied it. Here's the old and new layout.

The major differences are that the site identity remains while you scroll through the blog posts. And the code highlighting is more prominent. I love syntax highlighting. Check it out:
