## Overview of some terms ##

* The **product backlog** is the list of all user stories the team will deliver for the product.
* A **user story** describes what the system should do, in a way that emphasizes value to a user or customer. It is usually written in one or two sentences of everyday language.
* A best practice for user stories is to write them from the point of view of the user. This template is often used: As _who_, I want _what_, so that _why_.
* **Story points** are a unit of measure for expressing the overall size of a user story. Story points are relative. A story that is assigned four points should require twice as much effort as a story that is assigned two points.
