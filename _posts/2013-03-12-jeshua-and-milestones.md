Although it's such a simple thing it's very rewarding to watch when your child achieves something they couldn't do before.

Jeshua, finally at 2 and half years old is able to pedal his tricycle. So simple, but such a joy to see.

Alright kid, when are you going to be ready to race some motorcycles?  :)
