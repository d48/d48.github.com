# Definition

**Delegation** pattern is where an object, instead of performing one of its tasks, delegates the task to an associated helper object. The helper object is known as a __delegate__ and is given the responsibility to execute a task for the **delegator**. This pattern is one of the fundamental abstraction patterns that underlie other software patterns such as __composition__, __mixins__ and __aspects__.
