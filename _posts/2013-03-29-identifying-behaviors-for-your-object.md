In coming up with the member functions or methods for your object in a class or module, there can be several behaviors that an object can have in real life. You don't have to identify all of them. Just identify those behaviors that are relative to the goal of your system.

## Example

If you had a `Motorcycle Racer` object and you were trying to identify the behaviors or methods he would have, some behaviors to consider are:

* startMotorcycle
* gridUp
* changeGears
* wheelie
* accelerate
* brake
* train
* eat
* rest

These are all certainly valid behaviors of a `Motorcycle Racer` but if the goal of our system was specific to racing and what happens on the track, then the last 3 on the list would not be relevant.

So ask yourself:
 
> What does the object do in relation to the nature of the system that is being developed?

And then go code. Wootie.
