# Book notes

Starting to read this book from John Resig. It's promising as it cites core of Javascript regarding __objects, function, and closures__, and how the use of timers and regular expressions in popular javascript libraries can help you write better web applications.

I've been digging into coding cross-browser javascript for my current place of work at [BlackLine](http://www.blackline.com) so I'm looking forward to learning more of how John contributed to the *jQuery* library and insights from those efforts.

# Things to consider

# On Testing

Good test exhibit 3 characteristics:

1. **Repeatability** - tests should be highly reproducible and have the same results.
2. **Simplicity** - tests should focus on one thing.
3. **Independence** - tests should execute in isolation, break them down in smallest possible unit, which helps determine the source of bugs
