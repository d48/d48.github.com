# Javascript Timers

* JavaScript  engines  only  have  a  **single  thread**,  forcing  asynchronous  events  to  
queue  waiting  for execution.
* `setTimeout` and `setInterval` are fundamentally different in how they execute 
asynchronous code.
* If a timer is blocked from immediately being executed it will be delayed until the next 
possible time of execution (which will be longer than the desired delay).
* Intervals may execute back-to-back with no delay if they take long enough to 
execute (longer than the specified delay).
