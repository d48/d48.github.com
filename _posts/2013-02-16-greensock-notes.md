I just came across this JavaScript animation framework and I have to say it's really easy to use because of the API they created. Here's a couple notes from the "Getting Started" docs.

## Highlights

* Can pause and resume animation with event handlers
* Can animate css properties 
* Set delay before animate starts
* Can animate multiple properties and give different timelines for each
