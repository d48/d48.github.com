{% include JB/setup %}

Was configuring a local dev environment to test some php files that I'm symlinking from my `~/username/Sites` folder. Need to make sure:

1. Be sure to add this option in `/etc/apache2/users/username.conf` file: `Options Indexes Multiviews FollowSymLinks`
2. `chmod a+rx` on Dropbox directory and project directory
3. `sudo /usr/sbin/apachectl restart`

Wootiness.
