I'm evaluating [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) JavaScript IDE and I have to say it was super easy to setup and use. I'm working on a command-line app to create and manage [todo lists](http://github.com/d48/todo) and the usual suspects for debugging node.js like `node-inspector` was just clunky to set up.

Below is a screenshot that shows how I used the **WebStorm** debugger on my `mocha` tests. Suhweeet.

__Note:__ Just follow this tutorial to set up the debugger with your `node` and `mocha` libraries: [Debugging Mocha unit tests with WebStorm step-by-step](http://codebetter.com/glennblock/2013/01/17/debugging-mocha-unit-tests-with-webstorm-step-by-step/)
