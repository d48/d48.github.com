# Definition

A programming language is said to have **first-class functions** if it treats its functions as __first-class citizens__(an object, entity, or value), or an entity that can be constructed at run-time, passed as a parameter, returned from a subroutine, or assigned to a variable.

First-class functions are a necessity in a functional programming style, in which use of higher-order functions is a standard practice. 

In mathematics and computer science, **higher-order functions** (also functional form, functional, or functor) is a function that does at least one of the following:

* take one or more functions as an input
* output a function
