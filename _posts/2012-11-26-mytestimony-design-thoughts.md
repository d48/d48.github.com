Just starting to go through and research different UI ideas for how to render MyTestimony website project I'm working on. I'm really excited to be able to have the opportunity to work on a website like this. I feel it honors God and will be a great tool for believers to use as well as help those that don't believe to learn about God.

here's a sample screenshot of the mock of the home screen.

There's still tons of work but will just be working on it iteratively to make some progress. My Goal is to complete the beta by June 8, essentially my spiritual birthday when I came to fully believe and devote my life to Jesus.
