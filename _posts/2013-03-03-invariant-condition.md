> **Invariant condition** - In computer science, a condition that can be relied to be true during execution of a program. Invariants are especially useful when reasoning about whether a computer program is correct. 

## Examples

Explicit invariants is use of assertions in code. Some OOP languages have special syntax for specifying class invariants. Another example is a loop invariant - a statement of the conditions that should be true on entry into a loop and that are guaranteed to remain true on every iteration of the loop. On exit of the loop both the loop invariant and the loop termination condition can be guaranteed.
