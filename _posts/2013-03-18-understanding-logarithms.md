## Definition

> The **logarithm** of a number is the _exponent_ by which another fixed value, the _base_, must be raised to produce that number.

## Example

The logarithm of 1000 to base 10 is 3, becasue 1000 is 10 to the power of 3, or: 

`\( 1000 = 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 10^3 \)`

More generally, if `\( x = b^y \)` , then _y_ is the logarithm of _x_ to base _b_, and is written:

`\( y = log_{b}(x) \)` , so `\( log_{10}(1000) = 3 \)`
