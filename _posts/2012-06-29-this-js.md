## `this` keyword

When talking about __execution contexts__ for a script, the context contains references to various elements that represent state within a program to be managed according to the current logical scope. So how is the current value of `this` determinted in Javascript?

* `this` declarted in functions refer to the global context and it would be defined as `window` in a browser or `global` in Node.
* If you specify `use strict` within that function, `this` would then be `undefined` instead.
* If control enters a constructor like `new someObject()`, the `this` value will refer to the current object.
* So if a function is called on an object, or by using the `new` operator, then the value of `this` will be the current instance of the object, otherwise it will be the global context (or `undefined` in strict mode).
* The value of `this` is dependent on how a function is called.

## Examples

{% highlight js %}
function someName(x) {
  console.log(this);
  return x;
}

someName(1); // `this` refers to the global object, window


function someName(x) {
  'use strict';
  console.log(this);
  return x;
}

someName(1); // `this` is undefined


function Box() {
  this.x = 4;
  this.y = 10;
}

var rectangle = new Box(); // `this` refers to the instance, in this case `rectangle`
{% endhighlight %}
